# Portfolio

## General Information

This project is an updated version of my portfolio page that displays what I've learned throughout the course so far in order to become employer-competitive. 
This repository features Project 1 and 3 of my best homework assignments. I have also updated my LinkedIn and GitHub profile, as well as an updated resume. 
My updated portfolio page includes links to these profiles, a downloadable PDF version of my resume, exemplary assignments with links, and my contact information. 
I used Bootstrap CSS framework to ensure a mobile-responsive user interface and edited the CSS to look polished and unique. 

### About Me Page
The first page shows my picture as well as a brief description of my interests, and explaining what the website is about. 

### Portfolio Page
The second page shows the assignments I did, including Project 1. They all have titles, link to GitHub repository, and link to live application (or walkthrough video), as well as a gif that will play when the user hovers over the image. I used JavaScript and jQuery syntax to carry out this function. 

### Contact Page
The third page has all my contact info including GitHub profile, LinkedIn profile, StackOverflow profile, downloadable PDF resume, email address and phone number so anyone can contact me.
