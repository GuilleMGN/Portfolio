# Portfolio

## General Information

This project is an updated version of my portfolio page that displays what I've learned throughout the course so far in order to become employer-competitive. 
This repository features Project 1 and 3 of my best homework assignments. I have also updated my LinkedIn and GitHub profile, as well as an updated resume. 
My updated portfolio page includes links to these profiles, a downloadable PDF version of my resume, exemplary assignments with links, and my contact information. 
I used Bootstrap CSS framework to ensure a mobile-responsive user interface and edited the CSS to look polished and unique.
